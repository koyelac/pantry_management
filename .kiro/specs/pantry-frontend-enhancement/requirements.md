# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing pantry management application by creating a user-friendly web interface that matches the provided example.html template design. The application helps users manage and repurpose pantry items that are about to spoil within the next two days. The enhancement includes implementing the front-end interface with file upload functionality and adding a new inventory update endpoint that integrates with the existing backend agent system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access a visually appealing main page that matches the example template design, so that I can easily navigate the pantry management features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user visits the root URL THEN the system SHALL display a main page with the exact styling and layout from example.html
2. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL show two prominent buttons: "Upload Image for Analysis" and "Update Pantry Inventory"
3. WHEN the page is viewed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display a responsive layout that adapts to smaller screens
4. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL use the background image from the template directory

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload food images for analysis through an intuitive interface, so that I can get recommendations for items that might spoil soon.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks "Upload Image for Analysis" THEN the system SHALL display a file upload interface
2. WHEN the user selects an image file THEN the system SHALL validate that it's a valid image format
3. WHEN a valid image is uploaded THEN the system SHALL call the existing upload endpoint and display the results
4. WHEN the upload is successful THEN the system SHALL show a success message with the analysis results
5. IF the upload fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to update my pantry inventory through a simple button click, so that I can refresh my inventory data and get updated recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks "Update Pantry Inventory" THEN the system SHALL call the image.routine_agent() function
2. WHEN the inventory update is triggered THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback that the process is running
3. WHEN the inventory update completes successfully THEN the system SHALL display a success confirmation
4. IF the inventory update fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message with details
5. WHEN the inventory update is in progress THEN the system SHALL prevent multiple simultaneous update requests

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Flask application to serve the new front-end interface and handle the inventory update requests, so that the application provides a complete web-based solution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Flask app starts THEN the system SHALL serve static files (CSS, images, JavaScript) from the appropriate directories
2. WHEN a user accesses the root URL THEN the system SHALL return the main page HTML instead of the current JSON response
3. WHEN a POST request is made to the inventory update endpoint THEN the system SHALL call ImageAgent.routine_agent() function
4. WHEN the inventory update endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL return appropriate JSON responses for success and error cases
5. WHEN serving static files THEN the system SHALL handle the background image and any other assets correctly
